Bug Fix:
Pressing enter should close the dropdown (or pressing enter)
escaping the search box then disables the search results show up 
legend reflects the map domain and range, but it becomes misleading in tile view

Map
    - revert to original scroll method and figure out how to update viewstate that way. (WIP works but get non-breaking error)

General
    - introduction text should always be available on Spatial Equity chapter?

next up:

Chance:
Vertical histogram
Way to hide the line behind the histogram?
flip values so bad neighborhoods are at the top
Left allign the bar, put the x on the right side, remove the arrow
Color legend for the histogram boroughs

Bar chart:
Walk Bike or Ride transit text needs to be fixed 

Horizontal histogram
min and max need to be replaced with more specific wording, like the vertical histogram
number values should go at bottom of histogram
add units when possible
"Citywide Average" as opposed to "NYC"
