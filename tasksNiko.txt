Bug Fix:
- get data to legend

Legend Middle Column:

Map
    - revert to original scroll method and figure out how to update viewstate that way. (WIP works but get non-breaking error)
    - demographic legend
    - update how demographics are reported in the tooltip
    - update demo stuf for neighborhood scale

General
    - introduction text should always be available on Spatial Equity chapter?
